		<h4>Skin Rejuvenation</h4>
		<p>
			At Malvern Dermatology and Medical Laser Clinic, we are interested in the aging process and in utilising a variety of treatments to help preserve your skin, repair damage and reverse some of the changes associated with aging. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Sun damage accounts for most of the changes of visible aging so prevention is the best solution.  Always use sunscreen and sun protective clothing when outdoors for prolonged periods. Moisturisers with sunscreen may be adequate to protect you when walking from your car to the office but they are not adequate for protecting you at the beach or if you are intending to work or exercise outdoors for any length of time. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember sunscreen for your children. Sunburn in early childhood is more damaging to the skin than sunburn in adulthood.
		</p>

		<div class="sixteen columns">
		<p>
			Your dermatologist can prescribe creams to help repair sun damage and remove actinic keratoses and superficial skin cancers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Blotchy pigmentation (dyschromia) and redness can be treated with laser to restore clarity to the skin. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Less severe damage and dyschromia may be treated with medical grade peels. We have a range of medical grade peels that are stronger and more effective than those used by beauticians. Our mildest peels have no down time and can be used to ‘refresh’ your skin. Other peels may cause some redness and light peeling that may take 4 to 5 days to settle. Your dermatologist will discuss the appropriate peel for you. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="eight columns">
		<h4>Fillers</h4>
		<p>
			A ‘filler’ can last from nine months to two years depending on the type that is used. Fillers can be topped up before they have completely disappeared to maintain their effect and to increase their longevity.
			We do not use any permanent fillers at Malvern Dermatology and Medical Laser Clinic as these types of fillers may give rise to permanent and irreversible problems.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, as we age, our facial shape changes. We lose volume in the upper face and the skin sags and the lower face looks heavy and tired. Our dermatologists use hyaluronic acid fillers to help restore facial volume and to support the skin resulting in a fresher, younger look. At Malvern Dermatology and Medical Laser Clinic we only use hyaluronic acid. This is a pure molecule that is found naturally in the skin. It is degraded over time to water.

		<h4>Anti-Wrinkle Injections</h4>
		<p>
			Anti-wrinkle injection can be used to relax muscles and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. These muscle relaxants are available in a purified form. When injected into certain facial muscles it causes them to relax, and frown lines and expression lines will soften. It does not eradicate wrinkles, but over time wrinkles caused by repetitive facial expressions will become less prominent. Anti-wrinkle injections usually last from three to four months but many patients notice with repeat injections the effects last longer. The most common areas that we treat with anti-wrinkle injections are frown lines, crow’s feet and forehead wrinkles. Interestingly some patients find the injections reduce headache and migraines due to reduction in muscle tension.

		<h4>
			Our Lasers
		</h4>
		<p>
			At Malvern Dermatology and Medical Laser Clinic we only use properly calibrated, FDA approved medical grade lasers. These lasers are specific for haemoglobin (blood inside surface veins and capillaries) and pigment. When we laser the skin, the laser energy is taken up by surface blood vessels and pigment, so we get good results with little risk of damaging surrounding tissues.  
			Our lasers have inbuilt cooling or are used in conjunction with a Zimmer cooler, which cools and protects the skin whilst minimizing discomfort. Most treatments are completed within ten to fifteen minutes. Some tattoo removal treatments will take less than five minutes to complete. (Much faster than having them done!)
			Improvement is evident after one treatment but for best results most patients will need two to three treatments. Port wine stains (vascular birth marks) and complex tattoos will require more treatments.
